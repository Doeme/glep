The GLEP concept, and, in fact, much of the text of this document,
is liberally stolen from Python's [#Python]_ PEPs
[#PEPS]_, especially
PEP-0001 [#PEP1]_ by Barry A. Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger.

What is a GLEP?
===============

GLEP stands for "Gentoo Linux Enhancement Proposal".  A GLEP is a design
document providing information to the Gentoo Linux community, or describing
a new feature for Gentoo Linux.  The GLEP should provide a concise technical
specification of the feature and rationale for the feature.

We intend GLEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing *significant* new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into Gentoo Linux.  The GLEP
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the GLEPs are maintained as Wiki pages, their edit history is
publicly viewable. For the older GLEPs which started out in CVS, their
revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal [#CVS]_.


Kinds of GLEPs
==============

There are two kinds of GLEPs.  A Standards Track GLEP describes a new feature
or implementation for Gentoo Linux.  An Informational GLEP provides
general guidelines or information to the Gentoo Linux community, but does not
propose a new feature.  Informational GLEPs do not necessarily represent a
Gentoo Linux community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors
are free to ignore Informational GLEPs or follow their advice.


GLEP Work Flow
==============

The GLEP editors assign GLEP numbers and change their status. Please send all
GLEP-related email to <glep@gentoo.org>.

The GLEP process begins with a new idea for Gentoo Linux.  It is highly
recommended that a single GLEP contain a single key proposal or new idea.  The
more focused the GLEP, the more successful it tends to be.  The GLEP editors
reserve the right to reject GLEP proposals if they appear too unfocused or
too broad.  If in doubt, split your GLEP into several well-focused ones.

Each GLEP must have a champion -- someone who writes the GLEP using the style
and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate
forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea.  The GLEP
champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is
GLEP-able.  Small enhancements or patches often don't need a GLEP and can be
injected into the Gentoo Linux development work flow with an enhancement "bug"
submitted to the Gentoo Linux bugzilla [#BUGS]_.

The GLEP champion then files a bug on Bugzilla in the GLEP product, under
the "New GLEP submissions" component of the "Documentation" product with
a proposed title and a rough, but fleshed out, draft of the GLEP.  This
draft must be written in GLEP style as described below and in GLEP 2.

If the GLEP editors accept the GLEP, they will assign the GLEP a number, label
it as Standards Track (a better name would be nice here -- suggestions?) or
Informational, give it status "Draft", and create and check-in the initial
draft of the GLEP on the Wiki in the GLEP namespace.  The GLEP editors will
not unreasonably deny a GLEP. Reasons for denying GLEP status include
duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper
motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with
Gentoo Linux philosophy.

If a pre-GLEP is rejected, the author may elect to take the pre-GLEP to the
gentoo-dev@gentoo.org mailing list (for technical GLEPs) or
the gentoo-project@gentoo.org mailing list (for non-technical GLEPs) to help
flesh it out, gain feedback and consensus from the community at large,
and improve the GLEP for re-submission.

The author of the GLEP is then responsible for posting the GLEP to
the gentoo-dev or gentoo-project mailing list (and additionally to
the Gentoo Linux forums [#FORUMS]_ if they so desire), and marshaling community
support for it.  As updates are necessary, the GLEP author should request
changes to the Wiki page from a GLEP editor.

Standards Track GLEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference
implementation.  The GLEP should be reviewed and accepted before a reference
implementation is begun, unless a reference implementation will aid people in
studying the GLEP.  Standards Track GLEPs must include an implementation -- in
the form of code, patch, or URL to same -- before it can be considered Final.

GLEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a GLEP
before submitting it for review.  A GLEP that has not been discussed on
the mailing lists and the Gentoo Linux forums [#FORUMS]_ will not be
accepted.  However, wherever possible, long open-ended discussions on public
mailing lists should be avoided.  Strategies to keep the discussions efficient
include setting up a specific forums thread for the topic, having the GLEP
author accept private comments in the early design phases, etc.  GLEP authors
should use their discretion here.

Once the authors have completed a GLEP, they must inform the Gentoo Council
[#COUNCIL]_ that it is ready for review by way of the appropriate mailing
list.  GLEPs are then reviewed at a Council meeting where the may be approved
or rejected outright, or sent back to the author(s) for revision.  This
generally should be done a few weeks in advance of the actual review so as to
avoid the appearance of "slipping" a GLEP in without proper public review
by the Gentoo developer community. Any revisions should be added to the GLEP
bug on Bugzilla.

For a GLEP to be approved it must meet certain minimum criteria.  It must be a
clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.  The enhancement
must represent a net improvement.  The proposed implementation, if applicable,
must be solid and must not complicate the distribution unduly.  Finally, a
proposed enhancement must satisfy the philosophy of Gentoo Linux.

Once a GLEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be completed.
When the reference implementation is complete and accepted, the status will be
changed to "Final".

A GLEP can also be assigned status "Deferred".  The GLEP author or editor can
assign the GLEP this status when no progress is being made on the GLEP.  Once
a GLEP is deferred, the GLEP editor can re-assign it to draft status.

A GLEP can also be "Rejected".  Perhaps after all is said and done it was not
a good idea.  It is still important to have a record of this fact.

GLEPs can also be replaced by a different GLEP, rendering the original
obsolete (where version 2 of a policy, for example, might replace version 1).

GLEP work flow is as follows::

    Draft -> Accepted -> Final -> Replaced
      ^
      +----> Rejected
      v
    Deferred

Some Informational GLEPs may also have a status of "Active" if they are never
meant to be completed, e.g. GLEP 1 (this GLEP).


What belongs in a successful GLEP?
==================================

Each GLEP should have the following parts:

1. Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the
   GLEP, including the GLEP number, a short descriptive title (limited
   to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the
   contact info for each author, etc.

   Described further below.

2. Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
   being addressed.

3. Motivation -- The motivation is critical for GLEPs that want to
   modify Gentoo Linux functionality.  It should clearly explain why the
   existing functionality or policy is inadequate to address the problem that
   the GLEP solves.  GLEP submissions without sufficient motivation may be
   rejected outright.

4. Specification -- The technical specification should describe the
   specific areas of Gentoo Linux that would be touched by this GLEP.  If new
   functionality is being introduced, what packages will that functionality
   affect?  If new policy, who will be affected?

5. Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by
   describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions
   were made.  It should describe alternate designs that were considered and
   related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other distributions.

   The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and
   discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

6. Backwards Compatibility -- All GLEPs 
   must include a section describing any issues of backwards incompatibilities
   and their severity.  The GLEP must explain how the author proposes to deal
   with these incompatibilities.  (Even if there are none, this section should
   be included to clearly state that fact.) GLEP submissions without a
   sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

7. Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be
   completed before any GLEP is given status "Final", but it need not be
   completed before the GLEP is accepted.  It is better to finish the
   specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing
   code or significantly modifying ebuilds.

8. Copyright -- Every new GLEP must be explicitly labelled
   as licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA)
   license, version 3.0 [#CC-BY-SA3.0]_. Older GLEPs in the public domain
   should be relicensed to CC-BY-SA 3.0 when they are moved to the Wiki.
   GLEPs released under the Open Publication License (OPL) may remain
   as-is, but are strongly encouraged to be relicensed under CC-BY-SA
   3.0 with the consent of all authors.


GLEP Formating and Template
===========================

GLEPs are written in Wiki markup [#wikimarkup]_, which is a markup language
compatible with MediaWiki.  This format is both human-readable and displays
well on the Gentoo Wiki.  GLEP 2 contains a boilerplate template [#GLEP2]_
for use with Wiki markup GLEPs.


GLEP Header
===========

Every GLEP has certain attributes associated with it. When a GLEP is sent
to the mailing lists for discussion, it should begin with an RFC 2822 style
header preamble.  The headers must appear in the following order.  Headers
marked with "*" are optional. All other headers are required. ::

    GLEP: <glep number>
    Title: <glep title>
    Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
    Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
             Final | Replaced>
    Type: <Informational | Standards Track>
  * Requires: <glep numbers>
  * Replaces: <glep number>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses
of all the authors/owners of the GLEP.  Anybody who submits changes to
the GLEP should be added to this field.The format of the Author header
value must be

    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

    Random J. User

if the address is not given.  

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line
following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.

The Type header specifies the type of GLEP: Informational or Standards
Track.

GLEPs may have a Requires header, indicating the GLEP numbers that this GLEP
depends on.

A GLEP may have a Replaces header, which indicates that this GLEP supersedes
a previous one.  This header should contain the number of the GLEP that this
one renders obsolete.

When the GLEP editor enters the GLEP into the Wiki, they will be automatically
prompted for the contents of these fields, which will then be associated with
the GLEP as metadata.  The version of the GLEP stored on the Wiki should
not contain the RFC 2822 headers as part of the body of the GLEP.


Reporting GLEP Bugs, or Submitting GLEP Updates
===============================================

How you report a bug, or submit a GLEP update depends on several factors, such
as the maturity of the GLEP, the preferences of the GLEP author, and the
nature of your comments.  For the early draft stages of the GLEP, it's
probably best to send your comments and changes directly to the GLEP author
or comment on the GLEP bug. For more mature, or finished GLEPs you may want
to submit corrections to the Gentoo Linux bugzilla [#BUGS]_ under the "GLEP
Changes" component of the "Documentation" product so that your changes don't get
lost. Be sure to CC the GLEP author on the bug. When in doubt about where
to send your changes, please check first with the GLEP author and/or GLEP
editors.

GLEP authors must have a GLEP editor commit their changes to the Wiki,
as the GLEP namespace is restricted to GLEP editors in order to protect
the integrity of the GLEPs.

Any major updates to GLEPs (that is, those that change the content of
the GLEP rather than just fixing typos or adding small clarifications)
should be approved by the Gentoo Council before being committed.


Transferring GLEP Ownership
===========================

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of GLEPs to a new
champion.  In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author
of the transferred GLEP, but that's really up to the original author.  A good
reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the
time or interest in updating it or following through with the GLEP process, or
has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to
email).  A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with
the direction of the GLEP.  We try to build consensus around a GLEP, but if
that's not possible, you can always submit a competing GLEP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a GLEP, send a message asking
to take over, addressed to both the original author and the GLEP editors
<glep@gentoo.org>, or comment on the GLEP bug.  If the original author doesn't
respond to email in a timely manner, the GLEP editors will make a unilateral
decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).
